      <h2>About Haddis Alemayehu Academy</h2>
    <img src="images/m11.jpg" alt="Students" class="image-about" />
      <p><strong>Haddis Alemayehu Academy</strong> is a special boarding school established in 2019 by a group of highly motivated private individuals who envisioned an institution that gathers the brightest minds from across the region. Located in Ethiopia, the Academy was created to offer a transformative educational environment for exceptional students—regardless of background—who demonstrate both academic excellence and strong moral character.</p>

        <div class="founder-description">
          <h3>Dr. Haddis Alemayehu</h3>
          <p>The Academy is named after the iconic Ethiopian author and diplomat, <strong>Dr. Haddis Alemayehu</strong> (1909-2003), whose legacy of wisdom, leadership, and national service continues to inspire our educational philosophy. Dr. Haddis was a renowned writer, best known for his masterpiece "Love to the Grave" (Fiqir Eske Mekabir), and served as Ethiopia's ambassador to several countries including France and the United Kingdom. His dedication to education, literature, and diplomatic service embodies the values we strive to instill in our students: intellectual curiosity, cultural pride, global perspective, and unwavering commitment to excellence.</p>

      <p>Students live and learn in a vibrant community that emphasizes academic rigor, personal discipline, and social responsibility. With small class sizes, personalized support, and dedicated educators, HAA is where potential is recognized and fully developed.</p>

      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>To nurture responsible, ethical, and academically excellent students who are prepared to lead with purpose, integrity, and vision.</p>

      <h3>Why We Stand Out</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We attract top-performing students from every corner of the region.</li>
        <li>We offer a full boarding experience designed for academic focus and community bonding.</li>
        <li>We emphasize moral development, leadership training, and civic responsibility.</li>
        <li>We integrate modern technology and teaching strategies to ensure a world-class education.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Over the years, Haddis Alemayehu Academy has achieved remarkable success both nationally and internationally. The school has consistently ranked as one of the top academic institutions in Ethiopia, earning the highest regional scores and maintaining a 100% pass rate among candidates for consecutive years. Our students have triumphed in various national competitions, including science fairs, debate championships, and academic Olympiads. In addition, the Academy has proudly sent numerous graduates to prestigious universities around the world—including top U.S. Ivy League institutions—on full-ride scholarships, a testament to the quality of education and mentorship provided at HAA.</p>

      <h3>Core Values</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> We uphold honesty, ethics, and trust in everything we do.</li>
        <li><strong>Academic Excellence:</strong> We pursue the highest academic standards and inspire a love of learning.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Service:</strong> We empower students to serve and uplift their communities.</li>
        <li><strong>Leadership:</strong> We foster vision, confidence, and responsibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Discipline:</strong> We encourage accountability, self-control, and time management.</li>
        <li><strong>Equity:</strong> We create opportunities for students from diverse backgrounds to thrive.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Vision & Future</h3>
      <p>Our vision is to become a national and continental model for holistic, high-impact education. By equipping students with knowledge, ethics, and the courage to lead, Haddis Alemayehu Academy aims to develop the next generation of scientists, innovators, educators, and changemakers.</p>

      <h3>Our Story Continues</h3>
      <p>What began in 2019 as a bold dream has become one of the most respected academic institutions in the region. With every graduating class, we carry the torch of excellence, equity, and service—lighting the way for generations to come.</p>
